I could always turn to my supervisor or co-workers with any question or concern. Additionally, a unique aspect of this program was the ability to help out in arraignment court and file custody cases. Handling arraignment court was a great learning experience because it allows a relatively new prosecutor the ability to understand the charging process and the penalties a person faces. I am certain that my future as a successful Deputy District Attorney was made possible by the opportunities I was able to seize as a participant in the Externship Program</p>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div className=\"team-member-wrapper\">\r\n                                    <div className=\"img-wrapper\">\r\n                                        <img alt=\"dudley\"\r\n                                        src={bittner}\r\n                                        style={{objectFit: 'contain', display: 'flex', alignSelf: 'flex-start', marginTop: '10px'}}\r\n                                        />\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div className=\"team-member-description\">\r\n                                        <h6>Lindsey Bittner</h6>\r\n                                        <h6>Deputy District Attorney</h6>\r\n                                        <h6>Fresno County District Attorney's Office</h6>\r\n                                        <p className=\"mt-4\">I was one of Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office’s first externs. I volunteered first time as a misdemeanor deputy for seven months. I was part of the five person misdemeanor team. I was assigned a specified letter block, and I was able to prosecute my cases from arraignment through trial. Although I have been exposed to criminal law my entire life, my externship with the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s office gave me the ability to practice criminal law for the first time in my life. I learned how to evaluate a misdemeanor case, and learn what it is worth. I learned how to tow the line between negotiation and upholding justice. I learned how to choose my battles. My peers in the office were helpful and learned attorneys. Even more importantly, my peers were good people. Without exception, every DDA I asked offered me assistance. I was under the supervision of a very experienced misdemeanor deputy. I had a chief who was willing to talk to me directly about my cases. He was even willing and eager to listen to my arguments before I made them in court.</p>\r\n                                        <p className=\"mt-4\">I have since been hired as a full-time DDA in the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office. I now prosecute general felonies, and have a case load of over 100 felony cases. I can say with certainty that my externship in Santa Barbara was a huge factor in me getting a full time DDA job offer. I love my job in Fresno County, and I owe it, in large part, to my friends and co-workers in the Santa Barbara District Attorney’s Office.</p>                                    \r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                           <div className=\"secondary-content\">\r\n                               <h6>Please Contact:</h6>\r\n                               <p className=\"mt-4\"><a href=\"mailto:jsavrnoch@co.santa-barbara.ca.us\">Chief\r\n                                 Deputy DA John Savrnoch</a></p>\r\n                                 <p className=\"mt-2\">1112 Santa Barbara St</p>\r\n                                <p>Santa Barbara, CA 93101</p>\r\n                                <p>Tel: (805) 568-2300</p>  \r\n                           </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </Fragment>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Externship;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
