The assigned attorney will determine if there is sufficient evidence to file criminal charges. </p>\r\n                            <p className=\"my-3\"><strong>HOW CAN I DROP CHARGES?</strong><br />\r\n                              Although the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office is interested in your input, a victim does not have the responsibility to either &ldquo;press&rdquo; or &quot;drop&quot; criminal charges. The District Attorney assigned to the case will review the law enforcement report to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to file criminal charges. If you have input you would like to provide to the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office, contact the Victim/Witness Assistance Program. </p>\r\n                            <p className=\"my-3\"><strong>WHAT HAPPENS AFTER CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE FILED?</strong><br />\r\n                              It may take some time for a case to proceed through the criminal process. The District Attorney&rsquo;s Victim/Witness Assistance Program has Victim Advocates available to provide an explanation of the criminal justice process and provide you with regular case updates. </p>\r\n                            <p className=\"my-3\"><strong>HOW DO I GO TO GET A &rdquo;RESTRAINING ORDER&rdquo;?</strong><br />\r\n                              At the time the officer arrives at the scene you may request an Emergency Protective Order (EPO) that is good for 5 business days from date of issuance. In order to obtain an extended order you may contact the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office Victim/Witness Assistance Program. If Criminal charges have been filed the assigned Victim Advocate can request an order through the criminal court. If charges have not been filed, your assigned Victim Advocate can refer you to other local resources to obtain one. Refer to &ldquo;helpful phone numbers&rdquo; on the back of this brochure. </p>\r\n                            <p className=\"my-3\"><strong>MY SPOUSE IS THREATENING TO TAKE MY CHILDREN AWAY, WHAT CAN I DO?</strong><br />\r\n                              There are affordable legal resources available to parents who are in a violent relationship and are concerned about immigration consequences, custody, visitation and child support. The Superior Court Family Law Facilitator Program staff is available to answer general questions and make appropriate referrals.
