Predators are relentless in their pursuit of children. To combat Internet crimes against children, we must work together because the responsibility to protect children belongs to all of us. The Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office is working with law enforcement, educators, and others to develop a program that teaches parents and community leaders how to protect children on the Internet. Our goal is to reduce online victimization, increase the level of reporting of criminal activity, and provide resources for families to help them guard against Internet dangers.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div className=\"secondary-content\">\r\n                                <p><a href=\"https://countyofsb.org/da/msm_county/documents/TIPSFORPARENTS.pdf\">Tips for parents</a></p>\r\n                                <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n                                <p><a href=\"https://countyofsb.org/da/msm_county/documents/FAMILYCONTRACT.pdf\">Family contract</a></p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </Fragment>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default DomesticViolence;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
