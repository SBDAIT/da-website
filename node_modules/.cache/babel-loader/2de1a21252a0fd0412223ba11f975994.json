provides an externship program to introduce new lawyers to the field of criminal prosecutions. Presently, in District Attorney’s offices across the state, there are many more applicants than are there open positions. We are often asked by new attorneys for the opportunity to clerk and gain valuable prosecution experience. New attorneys willing to commit to a six month externship program will do research and writing, argue motions, resolve cases on the readiness and settlement calendar, conduct preliminary hearings and when ready, will try cases before juries. They will also participate in the same training programs our lawyers are given. Our externs must pass a background check have the requisite Juris Doctor degree and be licensed to practice law in the State of California.</p>\r\n                            <h6 className=\"mt-4\">Testimonials</h6>\r\n\r\n                            <div className=\"team-member-wrapper\">\r\n                                <div className=\"img-wrapper\">\r\n                                    <img alt=\"dudley\"\r\n                                    src={tdix}\r\n                                    style={{objectFit: 'contain', display: 'flex', alignSelf: 'flex-start', marginTop: '10px'}}\r\n                                    />\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div className=\"team-member-description\">\r\n                                    <h6>Joyce Dudley, District Attorney</h6>\r\n                                    <p className=\"mt-4\">Joyce E.
